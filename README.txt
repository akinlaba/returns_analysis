The repository holds 5 python jupyter notebooks and a data dictionary
The Data dictionary holds information about the different columns in the dataset
Python jupyter notebooks:
Capstone+part_1: It holds a lot of the data cleaning and my initial take at trying to predict the return plus one with minor feature engineering (T+1)
part_2: It holds an attempt to predict T+1 with cumulative sum feature engineering
part_3: It holds an attempt to predict T+1 with sum of compount interest feature engineering
classification: It holds an attempt to predict T+1 as a binary label (above or below 0)
return_121: It holds an attempt to predict return 121 on day T
