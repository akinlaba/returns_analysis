Data fields

Feature_1 to Feature_25: different features relevant to prediction
Ret_MinusTwo:  this is the return from the close of trading on day D-2 to the close of trading on day D-1 (i.e. 1 day)
Ret_MinusOne: this is the return from the close of trading on day D-1 to the point at which the intraday returns start on day D (approximately 1/2 day)
Ret_2 to Ret_120: these are returns over approximately one minute on day D. Ret_2 is the return between t=1 and t=2. 
Ret_121 to Ret_180: intraday returns over approximately one minute on day D. These are the target variables I need to predict as {id}_{1-60}. 
Ret_PlusOne: this is the return from the time Ret_180 is measured on day D to the close of trading on day D+1. (approximately 1
day). This is a target variable I need to predict as {id}_61. 
Ret_PlusTwo: this is the return from the close of trading on day D+1 to the close of trading on day D+2 (i.e. 1 day) This is a target variable I need to predict as {id}_62. 
Weight_Intraday: weight used to evaluate intraday return predictions Ret 121 to 180
Weight_Daily: weight used to evaluate daily return predictions (Ret_PlusOne and Ret_PlusTwo).
